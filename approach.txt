## Our Approach
Equal Entryâ€™s approach to Audits and Training continue with our ability to look beyond the legal language to focus on the impact to individuals with disabilities.

The disability landscape is broad and can have conflicting priorities. Equal Entry uses years of experience to find the right balance to achieve the best results for all.

Our experience working with lawyers, as well as being key witnesses in lawsuits, has given us a unique perspective when it comes to explaining and justifying our client's accessibility compliance. We know how to help our clients protect themselves from frivolous lawsuits by showing baseline results and progress over time. This makes a big difference in reducing legal risk.
